# Knowledge Graph Viewer


This application is used to show the relationships between entities in the Google Knowledge Graph.

The application does not connect directly to the graph itself - instead it connects to the graph database, to which individual entities can be added using the created graphical interface.

The whole project was developed as part of the diploma thesis.

The application itself, as well as its basic description can be found here: http://89.221.219.40/.
